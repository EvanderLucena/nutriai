# Roadmap: NutriAI

## Overview

Migrate a functional single-file prototype to a production SaaS for solo nutricionistas in Brazil — preserving 90% of the existing UI while building a real backend (Java 21 + Spring Boot + PostgreSQL), adding WhatsApp AI as the core differentiator, and enabling self-service billing with LGPD compliance. The journey goes from monorepo scaffolding through core clinical features to AI-powered WhatsApp conversations, then wraps with billing, legal compliance, and automated deployment.

## Testing Standards

Every phase must include tests as part of its "Done" criteria. No phase is complete without:

### Frontend (Vitest + Testing Library)
- **Unit tests** for stores (`*.test.ts`) — state transitions, error handling, async flows
- **Component tests** for views (`*.test.tsx`) — rendering, user interactions, form validation
- Run: `npm test` (vitest run) or `npm run test:watch` (watch mode)

### Backend (JUnit 5 + Mockito)
- **Unit tests** for services and controllers — business logic, validation, auth
- Run: `./gradlew test` (from backend/)

### E2E (Playwright)
- **End-to-end tests** for critical user flows (`e2e/*.spec.ts`)
- Requires backend + frontend running
- Run: `npm run test:e2e` (from frontend/)

### Verify Gates
- After modifying frontend: `npx tsc --noEmit` must pass
- After modifying backend: `./gradlew compileJava` must pass
- After completing a task: relevant test suite must pass

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Monorepo & Infrastructure
**Goal**: Development environment is reproducible and all services boot together
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: INFRA-01, INFRA-03, INFRA-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Developer can clone the repo and run `docker-compose up` to start frontend, backend, PostgreSQL, and Evolution API containers
  2. Backend boots with an accessible health endpoint and PostgreSQL connection established
  3. Frontend serves from Vite dev server with hot reload inside the Docker environment
  4. Flyway migrations run automatically on backend startup creating the initial database schema
**Tests (infrastructure)**:
  - Docker Compose health check passes for all services
  - Backend `/health` endpoint returns 200 with database status
  - Frontend Vite dev server starts and serves the app
**Plans:** 3 plans in 2 waves
Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Monorepo scaffold + Spring Boot backend skeleton

  2. Light and dark themes render identically to the prototype (CSS custom properties mapped to Tailwind config)
  3. All prototype interactions work: sidebar collapse, modals, table/grid toggle, pagination, tab navigation
  4. App builds as a Vite production bundle with zero Babel standalone dependency
  5. All SVG visualizations (Ring, MacroRings, Sparkline, WeekBars, LineChart, StackBar) render correctly
**Tests (component)**:
  - Vitest component tests for each migrated view (rendering, interactions)
  - `npx tsc --noEmit` passes with zero errors

  - **E2E (Playwright)**: checkout flow (with Stripe test mode), subscription management, patient limit enforcement, trial expiration redirect
**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 9: LGPD Compliance
**Goal**: Application complies with Brazilian data protection requirements for health data

  2. Terms of service and privacy policy pages are publicly accessible and linkable
  3. Nutritionist can export all their data and request full account deletion
**Tests**:

### Phase 10: CI/CD & Deployment
**Goal**: Application deploys automatically to production VPS on push
**Depends on**: Phase 8, Phase 9
**Requirements**: INFRA-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Push to main branch triggers an automated GitHub Actions pipeline that builds and deploys both frontend and backend
  2. Frontend builds as static files served by Nginx on the VPS with SSL
  3. Backend deploys as a Docker container with health checks and automatic restarts
**Tests**:
  - **CI/CD (GitHub Actions)**: Pipeline runs lint, typecheck, unit tests, E2E tests on every push
  - **Smoke tests**: After deploy, health endpoint returns 200, frontend loads, login flow works
  - **Rollback test**: Failed deployment triggers automatic rollback to previous version
**Plans**: TBD

## Progress

**Execution Order:**
Phases execute in numeric order: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9 → 10

Note: Phase 6 depends on both Phase 4 and Phase 5 (history snapshots consume MealPlanService, lifecycle events modify it).
Phase 7 depends on Phase 5 and Phase 6 (uses EpisodeHistoryEvent infrastructure and dashboard structure).
Phase 8 depends on Phase 3 and Phase 4 (patient counts for tier enforcement) — can run in parallel with 5-7.
Phase 9 depends on Phases 4-7 (data export must cover patients, meal plans, biometry, and WhatsApp data).
Phase 10 depends on both Phase 8 and Phase 9 (deploy complete SaaS with billing and compliance).
